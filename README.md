# MeasurementBot
## What
MeasurementBot is the next generation of measurement comparison tools and is due to revolutionise the landscape of comparisons and visualisations.
## Why
We, the developers of MeasurementBot, felt that the world didn't have enough empathy, enough grip on reality or nearly enough measurements to be able to function correctly. If my friend tells me he's just run 2 miles after being pursued by a bear, resulting in major lacerations and claw inflicted injuries, then I'm not going to have enough context on that story to be able to feel any real emotion for him. However, if I then use MeasurementBot to convert those 2 miles into a better unit such as bees wings or the diameter of Jupiter, then I'll be able to internalise his pain and truly suffer along with him.
